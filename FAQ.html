  <div class="body">
    <p>
 <b>Q: How do you already have an FAQ, aren't you new with no followers?</b><p>
Thats simple, I'm making them up. Nobody has asked me these, but they are questions I expect, I will add real questions if they ever come, you can send yours to <a href = "mailto: Questions@cryptokindergarten.io">Questions@cryptokindergarten.io</a>
<p>
<b>Q: Why is does your website look so bad?</b><p> 
1.  I'd like to focus on video content more than anything else so I didn't want to put a lot of time or resources into the site, This is a 'passion project' which is nice way of saying it doesn't make money.
This is a complete DIY project with as low a budget as possible.<p>
2.  I see a parallel between this technology and the rise of computers and the internet.  You may be old enough to remember when this is what the internet looked like and sounded like(for the younger people to truly get the experience hit the play button at the top left and imagine that you weren't allowed to turn it on or off sometimes, then also imagine 5 popups every time you change pages), this is about were I believe blockchain technology is comparably today. 
Rough around the edges, but its building into something that is so much more. <b> WE ARE STILL EARLY *Opinion</b><p>
<b>Q: Would you like to collaborate and cross promote with our project?</b>

<p>
The scope of my focus is going to be on projects and applications that provide tangible benefits that a skeptical non-crypto audience can easily understand. 
For the most part I will not be talking about any NFT projects. If you're project from any platform fits that description send an email to <a href = "mailto: heycheckusout@cryptokindergarten.io">heycheckusout@cryptokindergarten.io</a>. 

<p> 
<b>Q: Can you tell me which coins will go up in value? </b>
<p>No. Maybe I can introduce you to something and give you information. Whether something will be worth more or less later I leave to you, I make no price predictions. 
If you looking for someone to tell you whats the next big thing, whats going to 10x or 100x, I only give you this advice, don't
listen to anyone that says these kinds of things. Some people win but most people lose playing that game and most of people making these claims can't be trusted. My personal
belief is that the real opportunities will be found in projects harnessing blockchain tehnology to improve a vast number of systems, not in some memecoin ponzi scheme. There is a very compelling stock market in this Casino, you should come check it out. 
<P>                           
<b>Q: I want to talk about NFT's why aren't you talking about NFT's</b>   
<p>
It's not my focus but I will (eventually) talk about use cases for NFT's but it will be much more broad and will not likely involve any specific project. There are plenty of others talking about it
and I don't need to be in the mix. 
<P>                           
<b>Q: Is any of your content paid for by sponsors?</b>   
<p>
No. For the integrity of the content I do not request any money to be featured or talked about. However, I will be giving anyone and everyone the ability to pay for advertising of videos and any guests can 
specify their video to be promoted. In that case I would do an 85/15 split, in which 85% of goes directly to advertising paying for twitter, youtube, google or tiktok video promotion services. I am taking the 15% as a way to generate some revenue for the work,
and to improve the project overall. So in a way you could say that maybe I am getting paid, but I am honestly not expecting it. There is no expectation of payment from guests, 
I seek projects that I find interesting and that are doing something that I think can resonate with a general audience.
I am specifically planning for a no budget operation to make sure I can maintain objectivity as much as possible. I will be sure to mention any vested interest I have in any projects I talk about. My advice to everyoen is not to listen
to anyone that won't tell you if they are being paid to say the things they are saying.

<b>Q: Whats with the Kindergarten theme:</b>
<p>I got multiple answers for that. One very imortant one is this: It's a reminder to both you and myself that I am not an expert or professional, I am an amateur and enthusaist.
I am not a thought leader in the space and I never expect to be.I am not an authority in the space and should never be confused for one.This kindergarten setting is my visual reminder to "Stay in my lane". The space is full of many loud people that are not qualified to make the claims they do.
 Too many people pass themselves off as well informed experts, this isn't always done maliciously. My target primary audience is people who know very little about crypto. When you don't know much of anything on a subject, it can be difficult to know the difference between an expert and someone who just knows some things, Just ask anyone who had a grandma
with a computer in the 90's and 2,000's. One of my goals is t
<b><p>Q: I dont like you or your website </b><p>
That's not a question, but I appreciate your honesty.
